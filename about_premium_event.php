		The Super Eagles played out an unacceptable 4-4 draw in the first fixture, surrendering a four-goal lead as John Keister’s men left Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium with a point.

Victory for Gernot Rohr’s men against the Leone Stars will guarantee them a ticket to their 19th appearance at the biennial African football showpiece.

Having picked up an away point, Keister’s side would fancy their chances of stunning the Super Eagles as they are keen on qualifying for Afcon for the first time in 24 years.
